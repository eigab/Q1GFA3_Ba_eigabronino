            <p>The increasing integration of digital technology in high school students' lives has raised concerns about the impact of screen time on their daily routines and overall well-being. This doesnâ€™t only apply to us Philippine Science students but also in different high schools. This study goes beyond quantifying the number of hours students spend in front of screens; it delves into the reasons behind their screen use, the types of content they engage with, and the potential positive or negative outcomes associated with their screen time.  This knowledge can guide the development of strategies and policies that balance the benefits of technology with the need for a healthy, well-rounded high school experience, ensuring students are equipped to navigate the digital world responsibly while achieving academic success and maintaining their physical and mental health.
